# Automated Book Recommendation

This is an automation project which makes use of puppeteer, handlebars and pdfmake in NodeJS. This will run a script which will recommend you top 5 most read books of the week of the genre you want to read.

* This is a script that takes the genre, user want to read, as input.
* Extracts the data of top 5 most read books of the week of entered genre.
* Forms a pdf that contains book cover, book name, author name, rating and a brief description of each book.

* For the scrapping purpose, I have used a very popular site for books i.e. GoodReads.com
